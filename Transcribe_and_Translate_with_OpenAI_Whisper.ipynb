It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",

            "[02:17.820 --> 02:19.980]  As an example, and as you can see,\n",
            "[02:19.980 --> 02:24.260]  we can drag and drop between the two panes,\n",
            "[02:24.260 --> 02:26.180]  and then we save it.\n",
            "[02:26.180 --> 02:28.780]  Now, one thing I noticed, Hrithik,\n",
            "[02:28.780 --> 02:33.780]  is you are writing the data into a new table altogether.\n",
            "[02:34.820 --> 02:35.660]  You agree?\n",
            "[02:36.660 --> 02:37.500]  Yes.\n",
            "[02:39.140 --> 02:41.340]  Yeah, do you agree?\n",
            "[02:41.340 --> 02:42.540]  Yeah, yes.\n",
            "[02:42.540 --> 02:45.860]  I can't hear you very well, your voice is pretty low.\n",
            "[02:45.860 --> 02:47.420]  He's saying yes, Nadeshi.\n",
            "[02:47.420 --> 02:48.260]  Okay, okay.\n",
            "[02:48.260 --> 02:50.780]  Hrithik, can you please increase your mic volume?\n",
            "[02:51.820 --> 02:53.180]  Okay, okay.\n",
            "[02:53.180 --> 02:55.740]  Okay, so that is the most important part.\n",
            "[02:55.740 --> 02:57.420]  Now, one thing which,\n",
            "[02:57.420 --> 02:59.740]  the reason I pulled up this screen is,\n",
            "[02:59.740 --> 03:04.020]  please make a note that there will not be any new tables,\n",
            "[03:04.020 --> 03:07.260]  there will not be any new columns,\n",
            "[03:07.260 --> 03:09.260]  only changes in database,\n",

            "[03:15.980 --> 03:18.740]  The reason for that is because we are migrating\n",
            "[03:18.740 --> 03:21.980]  old framework projects into a .NET Core.\n",
            "[03:21.980 --> 03:25.580]  So all the functionality which we are going to add\n",

            "[03:27.540 --> 03:30.940]  is going to be exactly what it was in the framework,\n",

            "[03:32.500 --> 03:35.620]  It may be, the look and feel may be a bit different,\n",
            "[03:35.620 --> 03:38.180]  but as far as the database is concerned,\n",
            "[03:38.180 --> 03:42.140]  there are new columns, no new columns, no new tables.\n",
            "[03:42.140 --> 03:44.780]  So it's something what you were doing here, Hrithik,\n",
            "[03:44.780 --> 03:46.740]  like if I pull your projects,\n",
            "[03:47.820 --> 03:51.420]  let's say, where are we going to go?\n",
            "[03:51.420 --> 03:52.260]  Where are we?\n",

            "[03:58.380 --> 04:01.580]  Let's come back to data access project.\n",
            "[04:03.580 --> 04:04.980]  I'm not abandoned.\n",
            "[04:07.540 --> 04:09.940]  So let's look at the files here.\n",
            "[04:09.940 --> 04:12.580]  See, if you look at here, I was going through it\n",
            "[04:12.580 --> 04:16.500]  and there is insert into field operations,\n",
            "[04:16.500 --> 04:18.580]  field configurations, right?\n",
            "[04:19.460 --> 04:20.900]  Yes.\n",
            "[04:20.900 --> 04:23.300]  That is absolutely wrong, okay?\n",
            "[04:23.300 --> 04:25.380]  There's no, because now this,\n",
            "[04:25.380 --> 04:27.420]  I don't know if you have tested or what,\n",
            "[04:27.420 --> 04:29.740]  but this table doesn't exist.\n",
            "[04:29.740 --> 04:31.940]  So why would you be writing into this?\n",
            "[04:31.940 --> 04:34.100]  Now, the question for you is,\n",
            "[04:34.100 --> 04:35.900]  where do we write that information?\n",
            "[04:35.900 --> 04:40.900]  So that information gets into user settings table.\n",
            "[04:43.540 --> 04:44.780]  Not this tables.\n",
            "[04:58.620 --> 05:02.940]  See, this is what we write, asset edit UI,\n",
            "[05:02.940 --> 05:05.180]  and that's where the data goes into.\n",
            "[05:05.180 --> 05:09.020]  So for a given user, which is user account ID,\n",
            "[05:09.940 --> 05:11.940]  the property or the column name\n",
            "[05:11.940 --> 05:16.660]  or the setting type name is asset edit UI,\n",
            "[05:16.660 --> 05:18.380]  and that's where a docked information\n",
            "[05:18.380 --> 05:19.740]  would be written into it.\n",
            "[05:21.660 --> 05:22.500]  Make sense?\n",
            "[05:25.540 --> 05:27.660]  Narish, can I just note down the name\n",
            "[05:27.660 --> 05:30.820]  of this table, security.userSetting, right?\n",
            "[05:30.820 --> 05:33.580]  Yeah, so the call, now, Suryans,\n",
            "[05:33.580 --> 05:35.900]  normally you don't really need to look at it,\n",
            "[05:35.900 --> 05:38.540]  because if you look at the code, okay?\n",
            "[05:39.100 --> 05:42.260]  It would be a lot easier for anyone to find out\n",
            "[05:42.260 --> 05:44.380]  how are we doing this customization.\n",
            "[05:50.340 --> 05:53.940]  Let me see if I can find out edit forms,\n",
            "[05:53.940 --> 05:56.820]  edit UI customization.\n",
            "[05:58.980 --> 05:59.820]  Where is that?\n",
            "[05:59.820 --> 06:03.300]  I see UI, base control customization.\n",
            "[06:05.500 --> 06:06.700]  So if you look at here,\n",
            "[06:06.700 --> 06:08.860]  when we do save setting to DB,\n",
            "[06:10.260 --> 06:12.460]  you can find out from here.\n",
            "[06:12.460 --> 06:14.340]  Now, one thing which I like to tell\n",
            "[06:14.340 --> 06:17.140]  both of you developers is,\n",
            "[06:17.140 --> 06:21.300]  every time you work on an existing feature,\n",
            "[06:21.300 --> 06:25.260]  please have a look at the code into the framework.\n",
            "[06:25.260 --> 06:27.860]  That'll tell you how it has been done.\n",
            "[06:27.860 --> 06:31.020]  So it'll save you time, and it won't really,\n",
            "[06:31.020 --> 06:34.100]  and you would be able to use the existing API,\n",
            "[06:34.660 --> 06:38.500]  sorry, the web methods or the database methods\n",
            "[06:38.500 --> 06:40.620]  for you to do any read or write.\n",
            "[06:41.540 --> 06:43.180]  So that's where we are writing into it.\n",
            "[06:43.180 --> 06:48.180]  So this is under client, admin, edit forms,\n",
            "[06:50.100 --> 06:51.420]  base asset control.\n",
            "[06:51.420 --> 06:53.860]  I mean, that's obviously a control which we are using it.\n",
            "[06:53.860 --> 06:57.420]  So if you look at here, if I go back into here,\n",
            "[06:58.100 --> 07:01.100]  come on, out.\n",
            "[07:03.740 --> 07:05.020]  Let me move this.\n",
            "[07:05.020 --> 07:07.660]  Okay, so if we go, here are we.\n",
            "[07:07.660 --> 07:09.420]  So if you look at this page,\n",
            "[07:09.420 --> 07:13.500]  see, you can easily say which folder it is.\n",
            "[07:13.500 --> 07:17.500]  Client, admin, edit forms, and the ESP pages,\n",
            "[07:19.500 --> 07:22.340]  ESP, sorry, asset UI customization.\n",
            "[07:22.340 --> 07:23.540]  Once you go in there,\n",
            "[07:23.540 --> 07:26.100]  you can look at how we are reading or writing.\n",
            "[07:27.500 --> 07:28.340]  Make sense?\n",
            "[07:30.980 --> 07:31.820]  Yes.\n",
            "[07:31.820 --> 07:32.780]  Yeah, absolutely.\n",
            "[07:32.780 --> 07:35.340]  Okay, so that is something which I wanted to tell you.\n",
            "[07:35.340 --> 07:37.460]  And this, I was expecting this question\n",
            "[07:37.460 --> 07:40.020]  to be coming up a lot earlier, but that's fine.\n",
            "[07:40.020 --> 07:41.740]  We have, whatever you have done,\n",
            "[07:41.740 --> 07:45.180]  we have to just refactor it and put it in the right places.\n",
            "[07:45.180 --> 07:49.420]  Okay, so that's where we have both the customer custom fields\n",
            "[07:49.420 --> 07:50.380]  and a primary field.\n",
            "[07:50.380 --> 07:52.820]  So all that customized data would be saved\n",
            "[07:52.820 --> 07:56.660]  and retrieved from that table and that column,\n",
            "[07:56.660 --> 08:01.660]  which is security, user savings, user ID,\n",
            "[08:02.140 --> 08:07.140]  and the column property is asset, edit UI.\n",
            "[08:07.220 --> 08:10.900]  The data, the customized data is being saved here\n",
            "[08:10.900 --> 08:13.940]  and who is saving and is active and all that, you understand.\n",
            "[08:13.940 --> 08:17.540]  Now, do you understand the meaning of is active?\n",
            "[08:17.540 --> 08:19.300]  Because a lot of different people\n",
            "[08:19.300 --> 08:20.860]  use different meaning here.\n",
            "[08:20.860 --> 08:25.860]  Is active is, one means this column is available\n",
            "[08:25.860 --> 08:27.700]  for read and write.\n",
            "[08:27.700 --> 08:32.340]  If it is zero, that means that whole row has been deleted.\n",
            "[08:32.340 --> 08:35.420]  Because most of the data what we read and write\n",
            "[08:35.420 --> 08:38.100]  into our database is soft delete.\n",
            "[08:38.100 --> 08:41.980]  We do not physically delete a row, we do a soft delete.\n",
            "[08:41.980 --> 08:44.860]  So if I mark it zero, I don't know if there is anything\n",
            "[08:44.860 --> 08:48.780]  which is marked as zero, but I'll come back to that part.\n",
            "[08:48.780 --> 08:53.020]  So if I'm deleting this row, I will mark it as a zero\n",
            "[08:53.020 --> 08:55.540]  and that will make us, this won't be able to read.\n",
            "[08:55.580 --> 08:57.420]  So if you are going to make a change,\n",
            "[08:57.420 --> 09:01.340]  you can always mark it as set the values to zero\n",
            "[09:01.340 --> 09:04.980]  and that row would not be returning any data to you, okay?\n",
            "[09:07.940 --> 09:10.100]  Similar to what we are doing for asset,\n",
            "[09:11.260 --> 09:12.540]  we have for the people.\n",
            "[09:19.940 --> 09:21.340]  That's the marks, okay?\n",
            "[09:22.340 --> 09:26.020]  And that's where we have only one form to be there.\n",
            "[09:26.020 --> 09:28.380]  And this is like required, required.\n",
            "[09:28.380 --> 09:31.620]  Now, this is where you have one extra column says,\n",
            "[09:31.620 --> 09:34.020]  even though they are not marked as required\n",
            "[09:34.020 --> 09:39.020]  into the database, but if, when we say required,\n",
            "[09:39.260 --> 09:43.460]  the meaning of that required checkbox is that whenever,\n",
            "[09:43.460 --> 09:47.300]  if this column is being selected for UI,\n",
            "[09:48.180 --> 09:50.340]  person need to enter some value,\n",
            "[09:50.340 --> 09:54.180]  otherwise it'll give as app, no value entered.\n",
            "[09:54.180 --> 09:56.380]  We cannot mark it as nullable.\n",
            "[09:56.380 --> 09:58.540]  So that's what the is required means here.\n",
            "[10:01.460 --> 10:06.260]  Okay, now the second part which I noticed in your projects\n",
            "[10:06.260 --> 10:09.420]  is, let me pull up this one.\n",
            "[10:10.300 --> 10:14.700]  So this is my Netcore projects, okay, are the solution.\n",
            "[10:15.140 --> 10:17.420]  Controllers, which we all know, views.\n",
            "[10:18.620 --> 10:21.540]  Most of that, see as kind of a following\n",
            "[10:21.540 --> 10:25.540]  the similar folder structure as we had in a framework,\n",
            "[10:25.540 --> 10:28.940]  the client means all the client related views.\n",
            "[10:28.940 --> 10:31.020]  Now, when you say client, client in the sense,\n",
            "[10:31.020 --> 10:36.020]  because this application is a multi-user, multi-tenant,\n",
            "[10:36.300 --> 10:41.300]  a multi-process application where the same application\n",
            "[10:41.300 --> 10:42.740]  can be supplied to do many things.\n",
            "[10:42.740 --> 10:45.500]  For example, if I'm doing a farm integration\n",
            "[10:45.500 --> 10:48.260]  or a mining or a library,\n",
            "[10:48.260 --> 10:51.660]  the same application would be customized using the UI,\n",
            "[10:51.660 --> 10:54.460]  not the code change, and that's where we say,\n",
            "[10:54.460 --> 10:57.580]  so anything which is related to a client would come here.\n",
            "[10:57.580 --> 11:00.780]  Anything which is hardware related goes into hardware.\n",
            "[11:00.780 --> 11:03.780]  Anything related to applications having would go here.\n",
            "[11:03.780 --> 11:05.620]  So if you look at application text,\n",
            "[11:05.620 --> 11:08.380]  this is where we have done the other,\n",
            "[11:08.620 --> 11:12.700]  this is where we have done the user word customization,\n",
            "[11:12.700 --> 11:15.340]  which I'll come back to you, and order management.\n",
            "[11:15.340 --> 11:19.580]  So anytime when you are doing any changes related\n",
            "[11:19.580 --> 11:24.580]  to asset page, they should go in this folder, okay?\n",
            "[11:24.860 --> 11:28.060]  Anytime, which is anything related to order management,\n",
            "[11:28.060 --> 11:30.220]  they should go in an order management folder.\n",
            "[11:30.220 --> 11:34.140]  And similarly, so if you are working on the reporting,\n",
            "[11:34.140 --> 11:36.740]  you will create a new folder called report,\n",
            "[11:36.740 --> 11:39.500]  and that's where your report UI would go into.\n",
            "[11:41.220 --> 11:42.060]  Make sense?\n",
            "[11:43.060 --> 11:45.020]  Okay, okay.\n",
            "[11:45.020 --> 11:49.020]  Now, the other thing which I noticed in your code is,\n",
            "[11:51.540 --> 11:54.540]  which is something which I was not expecting,\n",
            "[11:54.540 --> 11:55.900]  but that's fine.\n",
            "[11:55.900 --> 11:57.780]  So let's come back to UI part.\n",
            "[12:06.740 --> 12:09.740]  Let's come back to reports, okay?\n",
            "[12:09.740 --> 12:14.740]  So you have hard-coded all these names here, okay, right?\n",
            "[12:17.980 --> 12:18.820]  Yes.\n",
            "[12:18.820 --> 12:19.660]  That is wrong.\n",
            "[12:19.660 --> 12:20.500]  The reason for that is,\n",
            "[12:20.500 --> 12:22.420]  if you look at our existing page,\n",
            "[12:24.940 --> 12:27.940]  you can see that there is a lot of information\n",
            "[12:27.940 --> 12:30.220]  about what's going on in our existing page.\n",
            "[12:30.220 --> 12:32.140]  So if you look at our existing page,\n",

            "[12:35.460 --> 12:38.300]  about what's going on in our existing page.\n",
            "[12:38.300 --> 12:39.340]  So if you look at this,\n",
            "[12:39.340 --> 12:43.300]  you can see that there is absolutely no hard-coding.\n",
            "[12:45.100 --> 12:46.420]  Now, how are we doing it?\n",
            "[12:46.420 --> 12:48.340]  Where is this data coming from?\n",
            "[12:48.340 --> 12:50.100]  You can certainly look at the page\n",
            "[12:52.100 --> 12:54.460]  and it'll tell you where the data is coming from,\n",
            "[12:54.460 --> 12:57.660]  but I'll show you which part is what we are talking about.\n",
            "[12:57.660 --> 13:00.780]  So if we go to report reports, that's where it is.\n",
            "[13:00.820 --> 13:01.820]  That's where it is.\n",
            "[13:02.940 --> 13:05.620]  So that's where the report data comes from.\n",
            "[13:06.500 --> 13:09.940]  So we have a report type, which is this ID,\n",
            "[13:09.940 --> 13:11.660]  and that's what I was showing you,\n",
            "[13:11.660 --> 13:13.460]  which is what you have hard-coded,\n",
            "[13:13.460 --> 13:15.860]  and the RDL names come from here.\n",
            "[13:17.820 --> 13:19.820]  Now, can you see this?\n",
            "[13:19.820 --> 13:22.700]  This is the RDL name, which obviously remains fixed,\n",
            "[13:22.700 --> 13:25.500]  but the title, what we show,\n",
            "[13:31.140 --> 13:31.980]  it's my,\n",
            "[13:39.580 --> 13:40.420]  I have it.\n",
            "[13:49.420 --> 13:51.340]  Where is my reports?\n",
            "[13:51.340 --> 13:53.700]  Oh, there, okay, so the report view.\n",
            "[13:53.700 --> 13:55.580]  Now, I'll tell you why you can't see something\n",
            "[13:55.580 --> 13:56.420]  on the left side.\n",
            "[13:56.420 --> 13:58.220]  So all these reports,\n",
            "[13:58.220 --> 13:59.060]  I've shown you,\n",
            "[13:59.060 --> 14:04.500]  side. So all these report types is nothing but a foreign key\n",
            "[14:08.100 --> 14:11.060]  of this into report, report type.\n",
            "[14:14.660 --> 14:17.540]  Right? So this is what we get it. Now,\n",
            "[14:20.260 --> 14:27.860]  while we are talking on this, what is the meaning of this curly bracket in the asset name,\n",
            "[14:27.860 --> 14:36.740]  people name, whatever. This is what we do called customization. So in the database, in the UI,\n",
            "[14:36.740 --> 14:43.700]  we would not hard code this as an asset. We would be doing in a curly bracket underscore asset\n",
            "[14:43.700 --> 14:50.180]  underscore and then curly bracket close. Now, what's the meaning of this? The reason why the\n",
            "[14:50.180 --> 14:57.780]  asset is a customizable word. If we are supplying this application to, for example, library,\n",
            "[14:58.420 --> 15:04.020]  there's nothing called asset over there. It's called books or documents. So at that time,\n",
            "[15:04.020 --> 15:10.900]  this word asset would become book or document. So whatever the name they want to like it,\n",
            "[15:10.900 --> 15:15.860]  that's what we'll call people. People is not everywhere the people is. Some people call\n",
            "[15:15.860 --> 15:22.260]  staff. Some people call employees. Some people call contractors. So that's what the meaning of\n",
            "[15:22.260 --> 15:28.820]  people management. So that's where be an order. Order is not where everyone likes order. Order is\n",
            "[15:28.820 --> 15:33.380]  like, you know, buying and selling. It's not really a lot of people have got different name\n",
            "[15:33.380 --> 15:39.060]  for order management because it's not really a physically order, you know, buying and selling.\n",
            "[15:39.060 --> 15:44.820]  But, you know, it can be a job order. It can be a project order. It can be many other applications.\n",
            "[15:44.820 --> 15:52.260]  So that's where we have. So once we, so these names comes out here. Now, when we display it,\n",
            "[15:52.260 --> 16:00.260]  so what happens is when we read these names, there's an API which we call. I mean, you can\n",
            "[16:00.260 --> 16:12.100]  look at it, but where is that? And so here we're getting all the report types, title. See here,\n",
            "[16:12.900 --> 16:21.380]  this API will translate all those custom words into the words which we have configured. Now,\n",
            "[16:21.380 --> 16:26.340]  how do we configure the words? I'm pretty sure you would have looked at it, but the\n",
            "[16:26.340 --> 16:37.780]  file type here, right? So item is asset, and that's where it comes in. So we can program asset name\n",
            "[16:37.780 --> 16:44.260]  as item, and item is being configured as asset. If I want to make a change to asset, I'm going to\n",
            "[16:44.580 --> 16:51.620]  So we can program asset name as item, and item is being configured as asset. If I want to make a\n",
            "[16:51.620 --> 17:01.060]  change to asset to tool, for example. So if the application is being supplied into a tool\n",
            "[17:01.060 --> 17:06.980]  management application, then it becomes tool. It's no longer an asset. People like to call\n",
            "[17:07.700 --> 17:14.180]  their assets as the tools. So I can make it as a tools. And then everywhere the word asset\n",
            "[17:14.180 --> 17:20.100]  comes in, it'll be referred as a tools, and it'll change. So it changes all the UI pages,\n",
            "[17:20.820 --> 17:25.380]  and it'll change all the reporting also where we have the same words used in the reporting.\n",
            "[17:26.100 --> 17:31.460]  How it changes, I can show you a little later on if we have time, but that's what the customizing\n",
            "[17:31.460 --> 17:36.260]  happens. You really don't need to worry about it, but it's good to know that this is where we have\n",
            "[17:36.260 --> 17:43.380]  all the words which we have used in the application are customizable by calling them with this\n",
            "[17:43.380 --> 17:47.780]  standard, and that's where it comes in. So if we show you in the new pages,\n",
            "[17:56.020 --> 18:02.820]  this is all my new .NET Core applications, and all the words are being configured this way.\n",
            "[18:03.380 --> 18:08.020]  So whenever I'm passing through, I'm still working on the customization application,\n",
            "[18:08.100 --> 18:11.940]  because there's so many pages to do, and I was waiting actually for your\n",
            "[18:12.820 --> 18:17.220]  form customization. Once that happens, then I can complete my customization, but\n",
            "[18:17.780 --> 18:30.180]  that is not checked in yet, and that's where we would do the translation of all the custom\n",
            "[18:30.180 --> 18:36.100]  words into user-defined words is done using this application. How this application works is\n",
            "[18:36.100 --> 18:41.380]  every time we compile our projects, this application gets called, and that will do\n",
            "[18:41.380 --> 18:48.260]  the translation. But as you can see, if we do it into the same folder, any changes which we are\n",
            "[18:48.260 --> 18:54.020]  making, they will be converted into the custom and non-custom words. So please make sure\n",
            "[18:54.580 --> 19:00.260]  that whenever you are doing this, create a separate published folder, and that's where you should do\n",
            "[19:00.260 --> 19:05.780]  the customization. So this becomes source, and that published folder becomes your destination.\n",
            "[19:12.820 --> 19:18.660]  Right now, if you look at this is my published folder. It's not all published, it's just EXE\n",
            "[19:18.660 --> 19:28.900]  only on, but we create a published folder where the application would run from. So all these pages\n",
            "[19:28.900 --> 19:34.980]  inside the web application only will be translated using a test application called\n",
            "[19:34.980 --> 19:42.900]  app customization, which would translate all these files into your published folder and translate them\n",
            "[19:42.900 --> 19:52.980]  into user-defined values. Make sense? Yes, Naresh. Rithik Saranshi, any doubts so far?\n",
            "[19:53.540 --> 19:57.060]  Please interrupt me any time if you have any doubts, Rithik Saranshi.\n",
            "[20:01.060 --> 20:06.260]  Okay, so that's where we have the user-defined words. Now coming back to what are we talking\n",
            "[20:06.260 --> 20:11.620]  about, reporting. Okay, so now let's come back to reporting what we were talking about.\n",
            "[20:12.100 --> 20:18.660]  So this is the different report types, right? If I look at asset management, based on that,\n",
            "[20:18.660 --> 20:23.060]  we get all these different reports which are there. So all these reports are coming.\n",
            "[20:23.060 --> 20:30.500]  So if I'm going to my report type, I think,\n",
            "[20:31.380 --> 20:38.900]  yeah, so this is all my asset types. So two, if you look at here, is my asset management type, right?\n",
            "[20:40.580 --> 20:45.300]  And that's what we have, asset management. Yeah, right, we have translated\n",
            "[20:46.820 --> 20:53.940]  the report type into the user-defined words, right? So that's what we're talking about here.\n",
            "[20:54.500 --> 20:59.060]  And that's what we have, asset management. Yeah, right, we have translated\n",
            "[21:01.460 --> 21:07.780]  the curly bracket asset into asset management, which is two, the ID is two.\n",
            "[21:08.980 --> 21:14.260]  And if we look at the same type here, which is two, all these are the report which are\n",
            "[21:14.260 --> 21:20.500]  asset management report. And if I look at any report which are related to pupil management,\n",
            "[21:20.580 --> 21:29.060]  I can do three. And that's what my, all the number of reports for pupil management are\n",
            "[21:29.060 --> 21:33.540]  quite different. Anyway, you don't need to worry about it because you would be implementing it\n",
            "[21:33.540 --> 21:39.860]  the way it has been done. So I strongly recommend whenever you start something, spend five,\n",
            "[21:39.860 --> 21:45.460]  10 minutes on a current project and see how it has been done, where are we reading the data from\n",
            "[21:45.460 --> 21:51.380]  into different APIs which are there. So all these methods, whatever being used in here,\n",
            "[21:52.500 --> 21:58.900]  should exist. So this exists. And if you look at here, get all lists. Now, this is a bit different,\n",
            "[21:58.900 --> 22:04.420]  right? Because now, because we are not using business object, we are using database access.\n",
            "[22:04.420 --> 22:11.540]  So you can see that how the data is getting read into this application. So if I'm going to show you,\n",
            "[22:11.540 --> 22:17.620]  let me just show one of them, controller, admin controller, or let's look at smitadmin.\n",
            "[22:26.420 --> 22:33.620]  Every report has the methods, right? So if you go back to repository and look at the methods,\n",
            "[22:34.580 --> 22:48.180]  new data. That's not repository. That's 12. Oh, sorry. My bad. Yeah.\n",
            "[22:52.740 --> 22:58.100]  While we are on this page, remember, do not write any SQL queries or\n",
            "[22:58.420 --> 23:06.660]  queries to controller. Nothing at all. Controller should be using the repository\n",
            "[23:06.660 --> 23:11.380]  and then making a call in there. Now, why do we need to put that? The reason for that is\n",
            "[23:12.500 --> 23:18.900]  all these methods are kind of indirectly related to a user which is accessing that.\n",
            "[23:20.900 --> 23:25.780]  Now, what does the user have to do with the methods? What happens is,\n",
            "[23:28.900 --> 23:33.540]  I'm switching between quite a lot, so please interrupt me if you get confused.\n",
            "[23:35.140 --> 23:40.740]  Oh, sure. No issue. So these are, for example, different users, right? Right now, this is a\n",
            "[23:40.740 --> 23:45.460]  single tenant application, what I'm showing you. Once we do a multiple tenant, then I'll come back\n",
            "[23:45.460 --> 23:54.740]  to you that part also. But have a look at here. We have a department. We have a company assigned\n",
            "[23:55.140 --> 24:01.380]  to a user, and we have a work site assigned. So these are three different factors which\n",
            "[24:01.380 --> 24:12.660]  determines what data is accessible by this user. Every asset or a person has got a location ID,\n",
            "[24:12.660 --> 24:23.380]  department ID, and a company ID. But if you look at every asset, let me open\n",
            "[24:24.340 --> 24:39.460]  this. Okay, we have kind of customized it, so that's why you don't see it. But we have a department.\n",
            "[24:39.700 --> 24:45.300]  Okay, let me show in here.\n",
            "[24:54.740 --> 24:59.860]  Okay, I see a number tag location. So we have a location, we have a department, and we have a\n",
            "[24:59.860 --> 25:07.700]  company, right? Now, for example, if I assign a department to this person, that means all the\n",
            "[25:07.700 --> 25:11.780]  assets which are accessible by this user would be...\n",
            "[25:18.740 --> 25:27.540]  So let's say this is the... Oh, come on. Come back. 39 is with me, my user. So this is my user.\n",
            "[25:29.940 --> 25:35.940]  So right now, I've not assigned any company, any department, any site to it. So what does that mean\n",
            "[25:35.940 --> 25:43.780]  is this user can access all the assets, all the people, because this is kind of a super admin,\n",
            "[25:43.780 --> 25:48.500]  which doesn't have any restrictions or anything. But if I assign,\n",
            "[25:51.540 --> 25:58.020]  let's say, department two, right? What that means is when this user logs in,\n",
            "[25:58.660 --> 26:03.220]  only asset belonging to department two will be accessible by this user.\n",
            "[26:05.940 --> 26:13.300]  That is one. Okay, similarly, if I assign a location to this user, for example, Westmead\n",
            "[26:13.860 --> 26:22.660]  or warehouse two, that means all the assets which are in warehouse two or assets which do not have\n",
            "[26:22.660 --> 26:29.780]  any location assigned would be accessible by this user. When this user logs in, that user will not\n",
            "[26:29.780 --> 26:36.420]  see the entire 123,000 assets which we have in our database, but only assets\n",

            "[27:10.180 --> 27:18.180]  What we were talking about, writing queries or any data fetch queries are done into a data\n",

            "[27:45.540 --> 27:51.540]  we can at least go back and look at what it is and what it was in the previous code. So that way,\n",
            "[27:51.540 --> 27:57.300]  if you have to really make a change into a method, create a new method. Or you can make change,\n",
            "[27:57.300 --> 28:04.580]  as I said, you can make a change into the query to return more data or less data, but do not make\n",

            "[28:44.580 --> 28:52.180]  you what this is. Now remember, all these store procs, you won't be able to see in this project.\n",
            "[28:52.180 --> 28:57.300]  The reason for that is, as you can understand, these store procs are common to a framework\n",
            "[28:57.300 --> 29:03.140]  application and a core application. So no database project is a part of a .NET Core.\n",

            "[29:27.300 --> 29:34.420]  Okay, so here we are. There you can look at it, how this method returns the data.\n",
            "[29:34.420 --> 29:39.460]  So as you can see, right now we are returning quite a lot of columns, and certainly you will\n",
            "[29:39.460 --> 29:45.380]  not be making any change to reduce the number of columns. However, if you have to add extra\n",
            "[29:45.380 --> 29:50.900]  column for whatever the application you are doing it, you can just add a column and change it,\n",
            "[29:50.900 --> 29:57.140]  because adding a new column is not going to make it incompatible with the old application. However,\n",
            "[29:57.220 --> 30:01.620]  removing a column certainly would break the compatibility, and then we will have a problem,\n",
            "[30:01.620 --> 30:07.940]  because remember, we are going to use the same database for framework application and .NET Core\n",
            "[30:07.940 --> 30:15.540]  application. They are no different at all. So whatever I'm doing now, I'm adding or modifying\n",

            "[30:43.300 --> 30:49.620]  end of the database, because that I can fill in. However, for testing, if you need to really\n",
            "[30:49.620 --> 30:55.860]  make a database call or anything, yes, and if you get stuck, please come back, send me a message,\n",

            "[31:11.460 --> 31:18.340]  One question from my side. So these stored procedures, would it be okay? For example,\n",
            "[31:18.980 --> 31:26.420]  we can create a new procedure like get items to. Absolutely. As I was talking on the beginning,\n",
            "[31:26.420 --> 31:32.420]  you can add a new stored procedure, you can add a new function, but you cannot add a new table,\n",

            "[31:40.820 --> 31:47.300]  messing with whatever is working. Yeah, exactly. Suryans, also, as you can understand,\n",
            "[31:47.300 --> 31:53.940]  there's no reason for us to add a new column. There's no reason for us to add a new table,\n",
            "[31:53.940 --> 31:59.620]  because we are replicating an existing functionality, which is working with the\n",
            "[31:59.620 --> 32:07.460]  current database schema. However, in case you really need to make a change of that type,\n",
            "[32:08.100 --> 32:13.140]  you need to communicate and say, what is the reason for you to add a new table or a new column?\n",
            "[32:14.980 --> 32:17.300]  And then we can work it out and see what can be done.\n",
            "[32:19.220 --> 32:25.380]  Yes, got it. We'll try to avoid adding new columns. Absolutely. I can guarantee you,\n",
            "[32:25.380 --> 32:30.260]  Suryans, you would not be required to add a new column. There's absolutely no reason for that.\n",
            "[32:31.060 --> 32:38.580]  Sure, Nadeshi. Okay, so, Rithik and Saranjh, is that okay? Yes, it is okay.\n",
            "[32:40.500 --> 32:49.220]  Right. Okay, so, now, I mean, I think this is the main thing I wanted to cover up,\n",
            "[32:49.220 --> 32:58.260]  which is the most critical part. What you need to do now, Rithik and Saranjh, is take the project,\n",
            "[32:58.900 --> 33:07.620]  create a new branch of the master for all these folders, what you would be requiring.\n",
            "[33:10.180 --> 33:19.060]  Merge your changes and remove all this hard coding of the text inside your ASP file or\n",

            "[33:46.660 --> 33:52.420]  to work on the project soon, so do not test that, which is a very, very old branch now,\n",
            "[33:52.420 --> 33:58.740]  because, you know, I made really hundreds of changes over a period of the last three months.\n",
            "[34:01.140 --> 34:07.700]  Similarly, dev2 was created by another developer who kind of delivered almost nothing.\n",
            "[34:08.820 --> 34:14.340]  So, that's why he's no longer with us. So, you would need to be creating a new branch name,\n",

            "[34:19.620 --> 34:26.180]  or whatever the name suits you, create your branch for all the repositories,\n",

            "[34:37.780 --> 34:43.300]  So, it shouldn't be a problem, and if there are, then you have to really merge your changes into it.\n",
            "[34:43.300 --> 34:46.340]  Do you, by any chance, have a beyond compare?\n",
            "[34:49.780 --> 34:50.500]  No, Nadeshi.\n",
            "[34:51.380 --> 34:56.420]  I think beyond compare is a very, very handy tool for merging because,\n",
            "[34:57.940 --> 35:03.860]  what about, how do you check in using a source tree, or you do a command line?\n",
            "[35:05.620 --> 35:07.220]  We use command line mostly, Nadeshi.\n",
            "[35:07.220 --> 35:12.580]  Oh, my God. Okay, you guys are really, I know there are a lot of people who use it.\n",
            "[35:13.300 --> 35:20.420]  I would recommend using source tree, if you have, at least play around with it. This is a free tool.\n",
            "[35:21.140 --> 35:25.460]  It's just really handy to show you what the changes have been made,\n",
            "[35:25.460 --> 35:30.660]  if there are merge conflicts, and anything will come up, but that is your part.\n",

            "[35:34.820 --> 35:41.540]  Now, what happens, let's say you got the latest, and now you're pushing a new change,\n",
            "[35:41.540 --> 35:46.740]  you forgot to merge the change, you forgot to take the latest is going to give you a problem,\n",
            "[35:46.740 --> 35:49.700]  and it's going to do whatever the merging it is going to do it.\n",

            "[36:34.420 --> 36:40.660]  And I will see if my current license can be shared. I'll check it.\n",
            "[36:42.980 --> 36:47.860]  Yes, Nehruji. Please don't buy an extra license or something.\n",
            "[36:48.660 --> 36:50.740]  I think we can manage the current setup.\n",

            "[37:01.780 --> 37:08.820]  So if, let's say, for example, this is my destination, which is the latest one,\n",
            "[37:08.820 --> 37:15.860]  I can copy it here quite easily without causing any problem, and you can add it.\n",
            "[37:15.860 --> 37:19.540]  So if I want to add it, for example, I want to make a change here,\n",
            "[37:19.540 --> 37:24.660]  I can make a change and save that. Whatever, okay?\n",
            "[37:24.660 --> 37:32.500]  Similarly, as you can see, all of the lines, which are different, no tools\n",

            "[37:47.380 --> 37:54.420]  Okay, so coming back to the sourcing, right? So what you, the next step for you guys is\n",
            "[37:54.660 --> 37:58.660]  really take the latest, create your own branch, merge your changes,\n",
            "[37:59.540 --> 38:05.460]  and try to remove all hard-coded text, what you have. Database APIs, as I said,\n",

            "[43:27.860 --> 43:31.380]  you have posted a message in that, but he hasn't given me anything on it.\n",
            "[43:32.820 --> 43:40.260]  Okay, okay. So I will try to tell him to get in touch with you by today, if possible.\n",

            "[43:51.300 --> 43:55.540]  Yeah, if he can get me within one hour. Otherwise, you said like after seven,\n",
            "[43:55.540 --> 43:58.580]  it's difficult. So I'll tell him to get in touch with you tomorrow.\n",

            "[45:09.700 --> 45:13.300]  Because I saw in one of the screen capture that this was there, but\n",
            "[45:13.860 --> 45:18.900]  in the code, I couldn't see anywhere. So I thought just I'll ask you, have you done this part?\n",
            "[45:20.900 --> 45:38.260]  Yeah, exactly. Exactly. You have to kind of override the previous menu\n",
            "[45:38.260 --> 45:42.900]  with whatever the button is clicking. And once we click on these three bars,\n",
            "[45:43.460 --> 45:47.140]  then we should go back to the previous one, the original one.\n",
            "[45:48.100 --> 45:53.540]  And remember, remember all these things, we customize based on the user permission,\n",
            "[45:53.540 --> 45:56.900]  which you don't need to worry about it. But if you look at the current code,\n",
            "[45:56.900 --> 46:03.220]  it'll tell you how this is kind of a customized based on what the user has a permission.\n",
            "[46:03.220 --> 46:07.780]  For example, I have access to reader configuration, but a lot of people would\n",
            "[46:07.780 --> 46:15.860]  not have access to reader configurations. This item would disappear. And if you haven't\n",
            "[46:15.940 --> 46:20.260]  really bought the license for the auto management, then this would disappear.\n",
            "[46:21.140 --> 46:26.820]  Analytics, a lot of people may not like to see it. So in general, you might see category,\n",
            "[46:26.820 --> 46:32.100]  manage assets, and that's about it. So this is all customizable\n",
            "[46:32.100 --> 46:34.420]  based on what the user has a permission for.\n",
            "[46:35.300 --> 46:40.980]  Is the screen visible? Yes, I can see it. Okay, so put tight, perfect.\n",
            "[46:40.980 --> 46:46.740]  I have created a new page, a reports page. Yeah, I saw that. Yeah.\n",
            "[46:48.740 --> 46:54.740]  So you can see it. Okay. So I have created a new page, a reports page.\n",
            "[46:54.740 --> 46:59.220]  Okay. So I have created a new page, a reports page. Okay. So I have created a new page, a reports\n",
            "[46:59.220 --> 47:07.220]  page. Yeah, I saw that. Yeah. Yeah. So if you select report management, you see all of them.\n",
            "[47:07.220 --> 47:14.180]  Perfect. Yeah. And everything else comes in. Yes.\n",
            "[47:15.300 --> 47:19.220]  So there's no framework DLA required. This is purely a .NET core, right?\n",
            "[47:20.340 --> 47:25.060]  Yes. That's really good. That's really helped me out.\n",
            "[47:25.060 --> 47:31.940]  Am I not getting any data? Which, okay. By the way, which database are you connected to?\n",
            "[47:33.700 --> 47:38.180]  Like it's asset tracking database. No, but which server?\n",
            "[47:38.820 --> 47:46.420]  The 20 point something server. Which is in the Azure. Okay. All good. Yeah.\n",
            "[47:47.300 --> 47:47.780]  Yes.\n",
            "[47:51.620 --> 47:58.980]  Like it takes time. Like it's. Yeah, I mean, you are running edit and roll. It shouldn't be taken.\n",
            "[47:58.980 --> 48:06.100]  That's a pretty. Can you load some other report with it, which is not taking that much time?\n",
            "[48:07.620 --> 48:12.260]  Like, for example, if you look at the people management, people data shouldn't be too long.\n",
            "[48:16.420 --> 48:33.700]  All registered off. Yeah. It shouldn't take that long, but at the data access from\n",
            "[48:35.060 --> 48:41.380]  Azure shouldn't be that long. If that's really causes a bit of a bottleneck for you, we may be\n",
            "[48:41.380 --> 48:50.020]  creating a database on your machine. I can give the backup data and what you can do is you\n",
            "[48:50.660 --> 48:54.100]  we have a, you can download the SQL express, right?\n",
            "[48:58.500 --> 49:06.660]  Okay. That's good. I mean, it's perfect. So really, because you are using the same RDL file,\n",
            "[49:06.660 --> 49:13.700]  same everything. So it should look exactly the same. So I'm really happy we saved a lot of time\n",
            "[49:13.700 --> 49:22.820]  by not creating a new thing and using an existing one. Is this okay? Any changes that you would like\n",
            "[49:22.820 --> 49:30.340]  to suggest? No, not at this point in time. Don't worry about enough. If I test it and find something,\n",
            "[49:30.340 --> 49:35.140]  I will let you know, but I don't need changes required at this time. No.\n",
            "[49:37.140 --> 49:46.100]  Got it. So you haven't done the other side toolbar, right? Reporting and that's good. I can see it.\n",
            "[49:49.460 --> 49:55.300]  Oh, it comes to the side one here. Okay. Yeah. I mean, it should be on the top of each of the\n",
            "[49:55.300 --> 50:02.900]  reason for that is right now it disappears because of post back, but in .NET Core, it should remain\n",
            "[50:02.900 --> 50:08.980]  until we click on the three horizontal bars. I mean, that's how the normal way the\n",
            "[50:14.820 --> 50:22.900]  expected behavior is. Yeah. And your asset assignment, asset assignment to staff,\n",
            "[50:22.900 --> 50:26.420]  is it a single word? How did you get these words? They don't look correct.\n",
            "[50:33.860 --> 50:40.500]  Really? Okay. No, I mean, okay. That's fine. You carry on. That's okay. We can look at that later.\n",
            "[50:40.500 --> 50:48.820]  No problem. Yeah. Okay. And okay. Now, can you show me the customization part if you have while we\n",
            "[50:48.820 --> 51:06.740]  are at it? Okay. Some fields required. Can you drag and drop how it looks?\n",
            "[51:10.260 --> 51:16.580]  Okay. Have you seen that after saving it, it comes back? Have you tested\n",
            "[51:17.220 --> 51:23.540]  changing the order? Like, for example, let's say if I put the serial number after asset type,\n",
            "[51:23.540 --> 51:30.900]  so if you drag the serial number, yeah, and put it after the asset type, keep going one more up\n",
            "[51:31.700 --> 51:39.780]  on our asset type. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Can you drop it? Oh, yeah. Perfect. So can you save it? So when\n",
            "[51:39.780 --> 51:46.580]  you save it, did you create a new table in your database? How did you manage to save it?\n",
            "[51:47.300 --> 51:54.340]  Naresh, this is using the table that you said we should delete, so we'll change it and refactor it.\n",
            "[51:54.340 --> 51:59.380]  Yeah, okay. We'll change that code and we'll refactor it and we'll make a video for you.\n",
            "[52:00.100 --> 52:04.740]  No, perfect. Now, that's all good. Now looking good. It's certainly looking exactly the way\n",
            "[52:04.740 --> 52:10.980]  it was implemented. So once you just refactor the code that we discussed and check it in,\n",
            "[52:10.980 --> 52:15.860]  I will do a little more testing and then you can move on to the next one. Yeah.\n",
            "[52:17.300 --> 52:23.540]  Yes, Naresh. So we'll connect this one to security.users, I think, right?\n",
            "[52:23.540 --> 52:29.300]  That's correct. Yeah, that's where all the settings are. So security, user settings, and\n",
            "[52:29.380 --> 52:35.620]  you can look at the tabs, what the column type is. You have the database,\n",
            "[52:35.620 --> 52:40.740]  you should be able to check it in. Yeah. Yeah, understood, Naresh. Okay.\n",
            "[52:44.900 --> 52:52.740]  Okay. Naresh, anything else that you wanted? No, not from my side. So what else have you done\n",
            "[52:52.740 --> 52:57.700]  other than these three things, customization of people and asset and reporting? Anything else\n",
            "[52:57.700 --> 53:06.260]  you did or not? So we're currently exploring the task that you gave. So the reports tab and\n",
            "[53:06.260 --> 53:12.420]  the analytics, the task that you gave, I forwarded to the team. So they're just trying to understand\n",
            "[53:12.420 --> 53:17.300]  how it was done in the old code. That is what we are doing right now. Okay. Fair enough. Okay.\n",
